oc_business.csv contains one row per business in our filtered dataset (the “business catalog”). It includes the business identifier business_id plus descriptive and location fields like name, address, city, state, postal_code, latitude, and longitude, along with quality/popularity signals such as overall stars, review_count, and is_open. It also carries richer metadata like categories, hours, and attributes (e.g., price range, delivery/takeout flags when available). Use this file to power the app’s core restaurant listings, map pins, business detail pages, and filter logic (category/price/location/open status). This is also the base table that other files join to via business_id.

oc_review.csv contains one row per review for businesses in oc_business.csv (the “interaction signal” table). Each row includes review_id, user_id, business_id, the review rating stars, engagement counts (useful, funny, cool), the review text, and the date of the review, plus engineered context fields like day_type (Weekday vs Weekend) and time_bucket (morning: 05:00–10:59 lunch: 11:00–16:59 dinner: 17:00–04:59 (everything else)). Use this file for recommendation modeling and analytics: building user–business interaction matrices, computing business-level aggregates (average rating, review volume trends), extracting text-based features, and understanding when/why users engage. It joins to businesses by business_id and to users by user_id. 

oc_user.csv contains one row per user who appears in oc_review.csv (the “user profile/features” table). It includes user_id, name, review_count, yelping_since, and other user-level fields present in the Yelp user dataset such as overall useful/funny/cool totals, elite years (if any), and friends (when provided). Use this file to create personalization features and user embeddings/weights (e.g., how experienced/active a user is, tenure on Yelp), to segment users (new vs experienced), and to support user-facing profile views if needed. The join key is user_id (linking users ↔ reviews).

ui_bundle.csv is a lightweight, UI-friendly subset of the business data (typically ~100 rows) selected to make frontend development easy and fast. It’s usually the “top” businesses for a target city (sorted by high engagement like review_count and high stars) and is meant to load quickly in iOS without needing the full dataset or any backend. Use this file for UI prototyping and demos—restaurant cards, list views, map views, search/filter interactions, and detail screens—while the recommender pipeline and analytics should rely on the full oc_business.csv/oc_review.csv/oc_user.csv tables.
